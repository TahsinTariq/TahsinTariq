# Hello There!! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Tahsin and currently I'm studying Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering.

While I'm not being bored to death in class, I love writting code to make stuff move on the screen.

Right now, I'm trying to [host a website on github](https://tahsintariq.github.io/), Learning to make generative art [using processing](https://processing.org/) and experimenting with Python and Linux.
